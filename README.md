# Perception-based-robotic-arm-grasping
Hello, I am Nitin, and I am currently documenting a project on Perception-Based Robot Manipulation and Grasping. In this project, I am utilizing the Panda Emika robotic arm in conjunction with the Intel RealSense D435 Depth camera. Initially, I implemented a Depth camera Plugin for simulation, attaching the camera to the world frame space. The primary objective is to use this camera to aid in detecting the grasp pose for object manipulation. Motion planning will be performed using the MoveIt API.
