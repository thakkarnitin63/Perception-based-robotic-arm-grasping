## Hello I am Nitin and I am documenting the project, I am on Perception based Robot manipulation grasping, where i am using Panda Emika robotic arm with Intel Realsense D435 Depth camera where I have first implemented the Depth camera Plugin for simulation and attached that camera to my world frame space where we are going to grasp the object and camera is going to help us to detect the grasp pose, and for motion planning we are going to performed in moveit api.
