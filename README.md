# Perception-based-robotic-arm-grasping
Hello, I am Nitin, and I am currently documenting a project on Perception-Based Robot Manipulation and Grasping. In this project, I am utilizing the Panda Emika robotic arm in conjunction with the Intel RealSense D435 Depth camera. Initially, I implemented a Depth camera Plugin for simulation, attaching the camera to the world frame space. The primary objective is to use this camera to aid in detecting the grasp pose for object manipulation. Motion planning will be performed using the MoveIt API.

### **Steps to Follow for executions:**
* Install Moveit on your system from this link : [Moveit](https://ros-planning.github.io/moveit_tutorials/doc/getting_started/getting_started.html)
   * You can try checking if Moveit install correctly by running this command in terminal :
     `roslaunch panda_moveit_config demo_gazebo.launch` this should open rviz with moveit configuration for           panda emika robotic arm:
* Fork this Repo: `https://github.com/thakkarnitin63/Perception-based-robotic-arm-grasping.git`
* In Repo, I have got Intel Realsense Plugin get that folder outside this folder(Perception-based-robotic-arm-grasping):`realsense_ws`
  * open terminal follow this command `cd realsense_ws` then `catkin make` this will build the catkin package       and your intel realsense plugin will start working to simulate the depth camera in gazebo since we are not      using real hardware
